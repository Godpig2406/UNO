This code defines classes for a card game, such as "card", "player", and "procedures". The "card" class creates an instance of a card with its uid, special status, color, properties, and name. The "player" class creates an instance of a player with an id, name, punished status, hand (list of cards), and next_player_id. The "player" class also includes methods for dealing cards, checking if cards are playable, choosing a card to play, and performing special effects for special cards. The "procedures" class includes methods for generating unique ids, checking if two cards are valid to play, and creating the initial deck of cards.

This code is an implementation of the card game called "Uno." It contains classes for the following objects:

card: represents a single card in the game, with attributes such as unique identifier (uid), special status (special), color (color), properties (properties), and name (name).
player: represents a player in the game, with attributes such as identifier (id), name (name), punished status (punished), hand of cards (hand), and identifier of the next player (next_player_id).
procedures: contains functions used in the game such as generating unique IDs (generateUid), checking card validity (check_valid), creating cards (create), and picking the color of the next card to be played (pick_color).
The procedures.create function generates the initial deck of cards, which includes cards of 4 different colors with properties such as "skip," "+2," and "change."
The player.deal function deals a certain number of cards to the player.
The player.check_playable function returns a list of playable cards based on the current card on the table.
The player.choose function prompts the player to choose a card from their hand or draw a card from the deck.
The player.special_effects function checks if the played card has special properties and updates the game state accordingly.
The player.debug function returns the player's debug information.
